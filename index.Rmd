# Introduction  

Disease elimination is an elusive goal that requires technical knowledge and practical implementation to be realized. To date only one human and one animal disease have been successfully eliminated through coordinated control efforts, smallpox and rinderpest, respectively [1]. Critically, integrating key aspects of the pathogen epidemiology and understanding features of transmission were likely key to acheiving this success [2]. 

Mathematical models are a powerful tool in the elimination arsenal and, combined with epidemiological studies, can help to develop ‘best-bets’ for control strategies [3]. Models can shed light onto the factors that drive disease dynamics, such as seasonality or age contact patterns; they can be used to estimate burden and costs of interventions; they can forecast future dynamics and also explore potential outcomes given different control and transmission scenarios. But it is also critical that models are grounded in data that are representative of the lived reality of people affected by a disease.

Canine rabies causes an estimated 60,000 human deaths annually, primarily in low and middle income countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia [4]. These deaths are entirely preventable: human deaths can be prevented through prompt post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and transmission can be interrupted in domestic dogs through mass dog vaccination. A target for zero human deaths due to dog-mediated rabies by 2030 (ZeroBy30) has been set by global health partners through implementation of a combination of these interventions [5].  At this critical policy juncture, research on intervention strategies and policy can greatly inform the path to elimination. Surveillance for canine rabies in endemic contexts is highly limited and available data are often restricted to urban and suburban centers with greater access to diagnostics and veterinary services [6]. In Chapter 1, I tackle this issue in a district in Madagascar, setting up a clinic based surveillance study to assess rabies burden and surveillance. I find that rabies burden and cases are signficantly underreported in the district, and use estimates of exposure incidence and health-seeking behavior to estimate burden. In Chapter 2, I integrate data collected from this study with routine public health data from across Madagascar to incorporate spatial access to PEP into estimates of human rabies burden and explore how expanding access to PEP can mitigate this impact, particularly in the context of a potential investment by GAVI in supporting countries to expand access to PEP. 

In Chapter 3, I review the existing body of dynamic transmission modeling work for canine rabies and identify key gaps and issues: primarily the paucity of data and of modeling studies that fit to data and the lack of a modeling framework which generates dynamics consistent with both endemic and epidemic dynamics. Finally, in Chapter 4, I tackle this gap by developing a simplified individual based model of canine rabies transmission, and fitting the model to a comprehensive long-term dataset of canine rabies cases and dog vaccination from the Serengeti District. I find that incorportating both the spatial scale of population mixing and the scale of control are critical to generating dynamics consistent with observed data, and with expectations in an endemic context. Overall, this work contributes in a multi-faceted way to tackling a pressing public health issue, both by generating key data and developing new quantitative approaches to taclking how best to control, and eventually eliminate canine rabies.
