<h2>Abstract</h2>
<div id="background" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is highly effective at preventing human
rabies deaths, however access to PEP is limited in many rabies endemic
countries. The 2018 decision by Gavi to add human rabies vaccine to its
investment portfolio should expand PEP availability and reduce rabies
deaths. We explore how geographic access to PEP impacts the rabies
burden in Madagascar and the potential benefits of improved
provisioning.</p>
</div>
<div id="methodology-principal-findings" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Methodology &amp; Principal Findings</h3>
<p>We use spatially resolved data on numbers of bite patients seeking PEP
across Madagascar and estimates of travel times to the closest clinic
providing PEP (N = 31) in a Bayesian regression framework to estimate
how geographic access predicts reported bite incidence. We find that
travel times strongly predict reported bite incidence across the
country. Using resulting estimates in an adapted decision tree, we
extrapolate rabies deaths and reporting and find that geographic access
to PEP shapes burden sub-nationally. We estimate 960 human rabies deaths
annually (95% Prediction Intervals (PI):790 - 1120), with PEP averting
an additional 800 deaths (95% PI: 800 (95% PI: 640 - 970) each year.
Under these assumptions, we find that expanding PEP to one clinic per
district (83 additional clinics) could reduce deaths by 19%, but even
with all major primary clinics provisioning PEP (1733 additional
clinics), we still expect substantial rabies mortality. Our quantitative
estimates are most sensitive to assumptions of underlying rabies
exposure incidence, but qualitative patterns of the impacts of travel
times and expanded PEP access are robust.</p>
</div>
<div id="conclusions-significance" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Conclusions &amp; Significance</h3>
<p>PEP is effective at preventing rabies deaths, and in the absence of
strong surveillance, targeting underserved populations may be the most
equitable way to provision PEP. Given the potential for countries to use
Gavi funding to expand access to PEP in the coming years, this framework
could be used as a first step to guide expansion and improve targeting
of interventions in similar endemic settings where PEP access is
geographically restricted and baseline data on rabies risk is lacking.
While better PEP access should save many lives, improved outreach,
surveillance, and dog vaccination will be necessary, and if rolled out
with Gavi investment, could catalyze progress towards achieving zero
rabies deaths.</p>

<h2>Author Summary</h2>
<p>Canine rabies causes an estimated 60,000 deaths each year across the
world, primarily in low- and middle-income countries where people have
limited access to both human vaccines (post-exposure prophylaxis or PEP)
and dog rabies vaccines. Given that we have the tools to prevent rabies
deaths, a global target has been set to eliminate deaths due to canine
rabies by 2030, and recently, Gavi, a multilateral organization that
aims to improve access to vaccines in the poorest countries, added human
rabies vaccine to it’s portfolio. In this study, we estimated reported
incidence of patients seeking PEP in relation to travel times to clinics
provisioning PEP and extrapolate human rabies deaths in Madagascar. We
find that PEP currently averts around 800 deaths each year, but that the
burden remains high (1000 deaths/ year), particularly in remote,
hard-to-reach areas. We show that expanding PEP availability to more
clinics could significantly reduce rabies deaths in Madagascar, but our
results reaffirm that expansion alone is will not achieve the global
goal of zero human deaths from dog-mediated rabies by 2030. Combining
PEP expansion with outreach, surveillance, and mass dog vaccination
programs will be necessary to move Madagascar, and other Low- and
Middle-Income countries, forward on the path to rabies elimination.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Inequities in access to care are a major driver of disease burden
globally [1]. Often, the populations at greatest risk of a given
disease are the most underserved [2]. Delivering interventions to
these groups is challenging due to financial and infrastructural
limitations and requires careful consideration of how best to allocate
limited resources [3].</p>
<p>Canine rabies is estimated to cause approximately 60,000 human deaths
annually [4]. Mass vaccination of domestic dogs has been demonstrated
to be a highly effective way to control the disease in both animals and
humans. While dog vaccination can interrupt transmission in the
reservoir, human deaths can also be prevented through prompt
administration of post-exposure prophylactic vaccines (PEP) following a
bite by a rabid animal [5]. However, access to the human rabies
vaccine is limited in many countries where canine rabies is endemic
[6–8], and within countries these deaths are often concentrated in
rural, underserved communities [9].</p>
<p>In 2015, a global framework to eliminate deaths due to canine rabies by
2030 (‘Zero by 30’) through a combination of PEP provisioning and dog
vaccination was established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and
partners [10]. Furthermore, in 2018, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, added
human rabies vaccines to their proposed investment portfolio [11].
From 2021, Gavi-eligible countries should be able to apply for support
to expand access to these vaccines, with potential to greatly reduce
deaths due to rabies.</p>
<p>A primary challenge in expanding access effectively is the lack of data
on rabies exposures and deaths in humans and incidence in animals in
most rabies-endemic countries [12]. Deaths due to rabies are often
severely underreported, with many people dying outside of the health
system, often in remote and marginalized communities [13]. Instead of
directly measuring rabies deaths, the majority of rabies burden studies
use bite patient data on reported bites at clinics provisioning PEP and
a decision tree framework to extrapolate deaths, assuming that overall
reported bite incidence (i.e. both bites due to non-rabid and rabid
animals) is proportional to rabies incidence (i.e. the more bites
reported in a location, the higher the incidence of rabies exposures),
and that reporting to clinics for PEP is uniform across space
[8,14,15]. If applied subnationally, these assumptions would likely
underestimate rabies deaths in places with poor access to PEP and may
overestimate rabies deaths in places with better access to PEP.</p>
<p>In Madagascar, the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar (IPM) provides PEP to
30 Ministry of Health clinics, in addition to its own vaccine clinic,
where PEP is available at no direct cost to patients [15]. Other than
at these 31 clinics, PEP is not available at any other public clinics or
through the private sector. In addition, there is limited control of
rabies in dog populations and the disease is endemic throughout the
country [16,17]. Due to the spatially restricted nature of PEP
provisioning and lack of direct costs for PEP, geographic access is
likely to be a major driver of disease burden within the country.
Previously, we estimated the burden of rabies in Madagascar nationally
using data from a single district to extrapolate to the country, but did
not account for spatial variation in access [15]. Here, we provide
revised estimates of human rabies deaths by incorporating the impact of
access to PEP at the sub-national level on preventing human rabies
deaths and explore the potential impact of expanding provisioning of
human rabies vaccines on further reducing these deaths. This framework
may usefully apply to other countries where PEP availability is
currently geographically restricted in considering how to most

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Estimating geographic access to PEP</h3>
<p>To estimate mean and population weighted travel times to the nearest
clinic, we used two raster datasets: 1) the friction surface from the
Malaria Atlas Project [18] at an ~1 km<sup>2</sup> scale (Fig S1.1A) and 2)
the population estimates from the 2015 UN adjusted population
projections from World Pop ([19], originally at an ~100m<sup>2</sup>
resolution, Fig S1.1B), which we aggregated to the friction surface.</p>
<p>From GPS locations of the 31 clinics that currently provision PEP, we
estimated the travel time to the nearest clinic at an approximately 1 x
1 km scale as described in [18]. We then extracted the mean and
population-weighted mean travel times for each district (2nd level
administrative division, N = 114) and commune (the administrative unit
below the district, N = 1579), and Euclidean distance, i.e. the minimum
distance from the administrative unit centroid to any clinic. We used
shapefiles from the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs for the district and communes boundaries (as of October 31,
2018). To see which metric best predicted ground-truthed travel time
data, we compared travel times and distance estimates to driving times
collected by IPM during field missions, i.e. time it took to travel by
car between two locations excluding break times (N =
<code>r</code>nrow(ttime_driving)`), and patient reported travel times from a
subset of Moramanga clinic bite patients (N = 1057), see Fig S1.2 for
raw data) by seeing which worked best to predict estimated travel times
in a linear model.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Estimating bite incidence</h3>
<p>We used two datasets on bite patients reporting to clinics for PEP:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>A national database of individual bite patient forms from the 31
clinics provisioning PEP across the country between 2014 - 2017.
These forms were submitted to IPM with frequencies ranging from
monthly to annually, included the patient reporting date and were
resolved to the district level (patient residence).</p></li>
<li><p>33 months of data (between October 2016 and June 2019) on patients
reporting to the Moramanga clinic resolved to the commune level.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the national data, some clinics did not submit any data, or had
substantial periods (months to a whole year), with no submitted data. To
correct for this, we exclude periods of 15 consecutive days with zero
submitted records (see Supplementary Appendix, section S2). For each
clinic we divided the total number of bites reported in a given year by
the estimated proportion of forms which were not submitted
(under-submission). Due to yearly variation in submissions, we took the
average of annual bite incidence estimates aggregated to district level.
We validated this approach by comparing estimated vial demand given the
total reported bites corrected for under-submission to vials provisioned
to clinics for 2014-2017 (see Supplementary Appendix, section S2). At
both the commune and district administrative level, we assigned clinic
catchments by determining which were closest in terms of travel times
for the majority of the population within the administrative unit. For
national data, we excluded any districts in a catchment of a clinic
which submitted less than 10 forms and any years for which we estimated
less than 25% of forms were submitted.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Modeling reported bite incidence as a function of access</h3>
<p>We modeled the number of reported bites as a function of travel time
(<span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>) using a Poisson regression:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu_{i} = e^{(\beta_{t}T_{i}\  + \ \beta_{0}\ )}P_{i}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_{i} = Poisson(\mu_{i})\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y_{i}\)</span> is the average number of bites reported to a clinic
annually and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i}\)</span> the expected number of bite patients presenting
at the clinic as a function of travel time (<span class="math inline">\(T_{i}\)</span>) and human
population size (<span class="math inline">\(P_{i}\)</span>) (an offset which scales the incidence to the
expected number of bites) for a given source location (district or
commune). We fit this model to both the national data (district level)
and the Moramanga data (commune level). To more directly compare
estimates between datasets, we also modeled the national data with a
latent commune-level travel time covariate (<span class="math inline">\(T_{j}\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{j}e^{(\beta_{t}T_{j}\ \  + \ \beta_{0j})}P_{j}\]</span></p>
<p>As travel times are correlated with population size (Fig S3.1), we also
compared how well bites were predicted by population size alone, and in
combination with travel times. For the models with population size, we
removed the offset and used either population size alone
(<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i} = e^{(\beta_{p}P_{i} + \beta_{0})}\)</span>) or population size and
travel times
(<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{i} = e^{(\beta_{t}T_{i} + \beta_{p}P_{i} + \beta_{0}))}\)</span>) as
predictors.</p>
<p>For the models fit to the national data, we also modeled variation
between clinics with a catchment random effect:
<span class="math inline">\(B_{0,k} \sim norm(\mu,\ \sigma_{0})\)</span>), where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the mean and
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{0}\)</span> is standard deviation and <span class="math inline">\(B_{0,k}\)</span> is the catchment level
intercept.</p>
<p>We tested whether the catchment random effect captured overdispersion in
the data (i.e. variance &gt; mean – the expectation given a Poisson
distribution) rather than any catchment specific effects by extending
these models with an overdispersion parameter:
<span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{i} \sim norm(0,\ \sigma_{e})\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{e}\)</span> is the
standard deviation around a random variable with mean of zero [20]:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mu_{i} = e^{(\sum_{j = 1}^{j}\beta_{j}X_{j}\  + \ \epsilon_{i})}P_{i}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{j = 1}^{j}\beta_{j}X_{j}\)</span> is the sum of the all parameters
for a given model. We fit all models in a Bayesian regression framework
via MCMC using the R package ‘rjags’ [21]. We used model estimates to
generate fitted and out-of-fit predictions, and examined the sensitivity
of estimates to adjustments for under-submission of forms (Supplementary
Appendix, section S3).</p>

<p>For <span class="math inline">\(E_{i}\)</span>, we center the distribution at the lower end of our

exposures/100,000 persons), with a range applied assuming 1% rabies
incidence in dogs (estimated across a range of human-to-dog ratios
between 5 - 25) and that on average a rabid dog exposes 0.39 persons
[4] (see Fig S4.1). As there is little data on dog population size and
human exposure incidence in Madagascar[16,23], the range we used
encompasses both observed human-to-dog ratios across Africa [14,24]
and recent subnational estimates from Madagascar [25], and generates
similar exposure incidences as observed previously across Africa
[26,27]. Given previously high observed compliance in Madagascar
[15], we assume that all rabies exposed patients who report to a
clinic receive and complete PEP, and PEP is completely effective at
preventing rabies.</p>

<div id="estimating-the-impact-of-expanding-pep-provisioning" class="section level3" number="3.2.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.5</span> Estimating the impact of expanding PEP provisioning</h3>
<p>We developed a framework to rank clinics by how much their PEP provision
improves access for underserved communities, estimating incremental
reductions in burden and increases in vaccine demand. Specifically, we
aggregated our model-predicted estimates of annual bites to the clinic
level. As multiple clinics may serve a single district or commune, we
allocated bites to clinics according to the proportion of the population
in each administrative unit which were closest. For each clinic, we
simulate throughput by randomly assigning patient presentation dates,
and then assume perfect compliance (i.e. patients report for all doses)
to generate subsequent vaccination dates. We use these dates to estimate
vial usage given routine vial sharing practices in Madagascar [15],
but assuming adoption of the WHO-recommended abridged intradermal
regimen (2 x 0.1 ml injections on days 0, 3, and 7 [28]). For both
burden and vial estimates, we take the mean of 1000 simulations as each
clinic is added.</p>
<p>We simulate expansion first to each district (N = 114) and then to each
commune in the country for all communes with a clinic. We select the
primary clinic (primary health facility, usually with capacity to
provision vaccines) in the highest density grid cell of the
administrative unit as candidates for expansion. For the 85 communes
without a primary clinic, we chose the secondary clinic (secondary
health facility, often without formal vaccination capacity) in the
highest density grid cell. 94 communes lacked any health facilities.
Finally, we explore a scenario where all additional primary clinics
(totaling 1733) provision PEP.</p>
<p>We tested three metrics for ranking additional clinics: 1) The
proportion of people living &gt;3 hours from a existing PEP clinic that
provisions PEP for which travel times were reduced; 2) This proportion
(1), weighted by the magnitude of the change in travel times and 3) The
mean reduction in travel times for people living &gt;3 hours from an
existing PEP clinic. We simulated expansion of clinics provisioning PEP
to each district using these three metrics and chose the metric which
decreased burden the most compared to simulations (N = 10) where clinics
were added randomly to districts for the full expansion of PEP. For the
full simulation of expanded access, once clinics reduced travel times
for less than 0.01% of the population (&lt; 2400 living greater than <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
hrs away, starting with <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> = 3 hrs), we reduced the travel time
threshold by 25%.</p>

<div id="sensitivity-analysis" class="section level3" number="3.2.6">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.6</span> Sensitivity analysis</h3>
<p>To test the effect of our model assumptions on estimates of rabies
burden and vial demand, we did a univariate sensitivity analysis of both
parameters from the models of bite incidence and the decision tree (see
Table S6.1 &amp; S6.2 for parameter ranges used). We also examined how
systematic variation in rabies incidence with human population size
affected burden estimates. Specifically, if human-to-dog ratios are
positively correlated with human populations (i.e. dog
ownership/populations are higher in more populated, urban areas), we
might expect higher rabies exposure incidence as population size
increases. Alternatively, if human-to-dog ratios inversely correlate
with population size (i.e. dog ownership is more common in less
populated, rural areas), we might expect exposure incidence to scale
negatively with population size. We use scaling factors to scale
incidence either positively or negatively with observed population sizes
at the district and commune levels, while constraining them to the range
of exposure incidence used in the main analyses (15.6 - 76 exposures per
100,000 persons, Fig S4.2) and simulated baseline burden, as well as
expanded PEP access.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Estimates of travel times to clinics are high and variable across Madagascar.</h3>
<p>Based on the estimates from the friction surface, approximately 36% of
the population of Madagascar are estimated to live over 3 hours from a
clinic (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig2">3.2</a>). However, we found that these estimates underestimated
both driving times across the country and patient-reported travel times
to the Moramanga PEP clinic (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig2">3.2</a>C). Patient reported travel times were
highly variable for a given commune compared to the estimated travel
times (Fig S1.2), potentially due to the fact that the friction surface
assumes that the fastest available mode of transport is used across each
grid cell (i.e. the presence of a road indicates that all travel through
that grid cell is by vehicle). However, patients reported using multiple
modes of transport, with some individuals walking days to the Moramanga
PEP clinic (Fig S1.3).</p>
<p>While the travel time estimates may not reflect exact distributions of
travel times, they were correlated with ground-truthed driving and
patient-reported times and likely reflect patterns of access over the
country (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig3">3.3</a>C, Fig S1.4). Travel times weighted by population at the
grid cell level were a better predictor than unweighted travel times or
distance (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.43, Table S1.1), therefore, we use
population-weighted travel time as a proxy for access at the
commune/district level in subsequent analyses.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> As travel times increase, reported bite incidence decreases.</h3>
<p>Bite incidence estimates generally increased with decreasing weighted
travel times at both administrative scales (district and commune),
although there was considerable variation between catchments for the
magnitude of this relationship (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig3">3.3</a>C and D). After additionally
excluding any year with less than 25% of forms submitted, our final
dataset consisted of estimates of average bite incidence for 83 of 114
districts (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig3">3.3</a>C), and 58 communes within the catchment of the
Moramanga District (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig3">3.3</a>D, see Supplementary Appendix section S2 for
more details). For the national data, there were two outliers, Toamasina
II (the sub-urban district surrounding the city of Toamasina) and
Soanierana Ivongo, with higher bite incidence when compared to other
districts with similar travel times. While the estimates from the
Moramanga data showed higher reported incidence at low travel times at
the commune level compared to the district estimates, when aggregated to
the district, bite incidence estimates fell within the ranges observed
from the national dataset.</p>

<p>Our modeling results show that travel times were a strong and consistent
predictor of reported bite incidence in both datasets and across scales
with the best fitting models including travel times and an
overdispersion parameter (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig4">3.4</a>, see Supplementary Appendix section S3
for comparisons to models with catchment effects and with population
size as a covariate). As the predictions of the model fit to the
Moramanga data without accounting for overdispersion fall within the
prediction intervals for the models fit to the national data (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig4">3.4</a>A),
for subsequent predictions, we used the parameter estimates from models
fit to the national data, which encompass the range of travel time
effects observed in our datasets. Moreover, our out-of-fit predictions
to the data across scales suggest that the commune model is able to
capture travel time impacts at the commune level (Fig S3.3), therefore
we use both the district and commune model to disaggregate burden to the
finest scale possible. Finally, we examined the sensitivity of models to
how we corrected for underreporting of data and found that parameter
estimates of travel time impacts were similar across models and
performed similarly in prediction (Fig S3.8 and Fig S3.9).</p>

are modeled at the district and commune scale, with the least accessible
communities having most deaths (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig5">3.5</a>B &amp; C). We estimate that under the

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Expanding PEP access to underserved populations is effective at reducing human rabies deaths, but this effect saturates as more clinics provision PEP</h3>
<p>We found that targeted expansion of PEP to clinics based on the
proportion of the population they reduced travel times for resulted in
fewest deaths (Fig S5.1). Here we report results from the commune model,
as estimates were consistent across models (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig6">3.6</a> and Supplementary
appendix, section S5). We estimated that strategic PEP expansion to
these additional 83 clinics (1 per district) reduced rabies deaths by
19% (95% PI: 14 - 23%) (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig6">3.6</a>A). With one clinic per commune (where
available, N = 1696), we see a further reduction of 38% (95% PI: 30 -
46%). However, reductions in burden saturate as more clinics are added
(Fig S5.2). Even when all primary clinics provision PEP, our model still
predicts 600 (95% PI: 400 - 800) deaths per annum, and average reporting
of rabies exposures remains approximately 66% (95% PI: 33 - 78%) (Fig
S5.5); as more clinics are added, reported bite incidence saturates (Fig
S5.4), and patients shift which clinic they report to (S5.7 &amp; S5.8).</p>
<p>Vial demand also outpaces reductions in burden (Fig <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#fig:ch3-fig6">3.6</a>B), with more vials

33500 vials (95% PI: 22900 - 49400) per annum under current provisioning
but with the abridged intradermal regimen (i.e. visits on days 0, 3, 7),
to ~56900 vials (95% PI: 40200 - 77800) with 250 clinics providing PEP,
and ~86400 vials (95% PI: 61600 - 118000) if all primary clinics
provision PEP. In these scenarios, clinic catchment populations and
throughput decrease, with clinics seeing fewer patients per day (S5.6).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.5</span> Burden estimates are most sensitive to assumptions of underlying rabies incidence.</h3>
<p>While qualitative patterns of the current impact of geographic access on
human rabies deaths and the impact of expanding access to PEP on
reducing these deaths is robust across a wide range of parameter
estimates, our sensitivity analyses show that assumptions of the
underlying rabies exposure incidence (<span class="math inline">\(E_{i}\)</span>) contribute the most
uncertainty to our quantitative estimates (Fig S6.1 &amp; 2). Uncertainty in
bite model parameters contribute less to uncertainty in estimates of
burden or impacts of expanded access. For the estimates of vial demand,
uncertainty around the model intercept (i.e. the baseline reported bite
incidence) has most impact, rather than the travel time effect or the
overdispersion parameter (Fig S6.3). Finally, scaling of incidence with
population size (Fig S4.2) modulates the impact of travel times on
deaths, with positive scaling of rabies incidence with population size
(i.e. more rabies in more populated places) dampening and negative
scaling exacerbating the relationship between access and deaths (Fig
S6.4A). However, the impact of adding clinics remains broadly the same
(Fig S6.4B).</p>

<div id="main-findings" class="section level3" number="3.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Main findings</h3>
<p>We find that the burden of rabies in Madagascar is likely concentrated
in areas with poor PEP access. We estimate that current PEP provisioning
(at 31 clinics) averts 45%of deaths that would otherwise occur, and that
expanding PEP access should reduce mortality, with provisioning in one
clinic per district (N = 83), or per commune (N = 1733), expected to
reduce mortality by 16% and 33%, respectively. However, improved PEP
provisioning is unlikely to eliminate rabies deaths; with over 600
deaths expected even with PEP at all primary clinics (N = 1733). This is
partly because travel times remain high (&gt; 2 hrs as estimated by the
friction surface for over 10% of the population, Fig S5.4) even after
expanding PEP to all primary clinics. With reduced travel times, over
20% of exposures will still not seek PEP (Fig S5.5), resulting in ~1.65
rabies deaths per 100,000 people. PEP is expected to remain
cost-effective as provisioning expands, to a maximum of 450 USD per
death averted (assuming 5 USD per vial), similar to other estimates
[4]. While our quantitative predictions depend on assumptions of
underlying rabies exposure incidence, the qualitative patterns regarding
travel time impacts remain robust and are useful in identifying
strategies for provisioning PEP.</p>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level3" number="3.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Limitations</h3>
<p>Data limitations introduced bias and uncertainty to our estimates. For
example, travel times from the Malaria Atlas Project friction surface
underestimated patient-reported travel times, with discrepancies between
assigned transport speeds (from the Open Street Map user community, or
country cluster data [18]) and realities of local travel. In
Madagascar, the presence of paved roads does not necessarily reflect
their quality or the modes of transport used. Patients seeking PEP at
the Moramanga clinic reported various transport methods and highly
variable travel times even within a single commune. While
patient-reported travel times may lack precision from recall and
estimation error, they likely better reflect lived experience; validated
travel times [30] could improve estimates of spatial health
inequities. Similarly, modeled estimates of population distribution
[19] also introduce uncertainty. Our analysis of data from the
Moramanga District indicates that variation at the sub-district level is
high and impacts health seeking behavior. However, we lacked fine-scale
data from other catchments for comparison. Additionally, we had to
correct for underreporting and incomplete data; strengthening
surveillance and routine data collection should improve understanding of
health seeking behavior and access, and support monitoring and
evaluation of PEP provisioning.</p>
<p>While we rely on a number of assumptions, they are based on data
specific to Madagascar or from other similar settings and consistent
with estimates from the literature more broadly (see Table <a href="how-geographic-access-to-care-shapes-disease-burden-the-current-impact-of-post-exposure-prophylaxis-and-potential-for-expanded-access-to-prevent-human-rabies-deaths-in-madagascar.html#tab:ch3-tab1">3.1</a> and section
S4). Our burden estimates were most sensitive to assumptions about
rabies exposure incidence, drawn from studies in the Moramanga District
[15] and elsewhere [4]. As incidence of rabies exposures varies over
time and space [31,32], we incorporated uncertainty into our
estimates, but we did not find qualitative differences in the effects of
travel times on rabies deaths. Our simplifying assumptions regarding
patient compliance, which is generally high in Madagascar [15], and on
complete efficacy of PEP are unlikely to greatly influence our burden
estimates [22]. Likewise, we do not account for differential risk for
severely exposed patients not receiving Immunoglobulins (RIG), which is
only available at IPM in the captial of Antananarivo, but recent studies
show that even in the absence of RIG, PEP is extremely effective [4].
We also assume that clinics reliably provision PEP, but a 2019 KAP
survey reported clinics experiencing stock-outs [25].</p>
<p>We assumed geographic access to PEP was the primary driver of
health-seeking behavior, but socioeconomic status, education and
awareness about rabies [[33]; [27]; [34]; [35];
castillo2020behavioral] all play a role. For example, most PEP clinics
also charge fees (from 0.50 - 3.00 USD for consultations, wound
treatment, etc. [25]) which may also act as barriers to PEP access. In
Madagascar, where PEP is free-of-charge, the main cost to patients is
transport and time lost. More remote communities tend to be of lower
socioeconomic and educational status [2], so travel time may be a
proxy for these correlated variables. Significant overdispersion in the
data that cannot be explained by travel times suggests that clinic-level
variation (e.g. vaccine availability and charges) and regional
differences (e.g. dog populations, outbreaks, awareness) further
influence health-seeking behavior and vaccine demand. Although our
estimates could be improved with better data on rabies incidence,
health-seeking behavior, and PEP provisioning, predicting PEP impacts
will remain challenging given the complex interactions between
socioeconomic factors, access to and quality of care, and human
behavior, as illustrated by the case studies in Box 1. However, it is
very likely that the impacts of improving access to PEP could be further
increased with outreach and awareness raising efforts that we were
unable to parameterize.</p>

<li><p>Anosibe An’ala District (population ~ 100,265), south of Moramanga,
has moderate incidence of bite patients (~ 54/100,000 persons) even
though travel times often exceed 24 hours. While a road connects the
main Anosibe An’ala commune to the Moramanga PEP clinic, it is only
passable by large trucks during much of the rainy season, with
speeds usually &lt; 10km per hour. Over 9% of patients from Anosibe
An’ala had been in close proximity or touched a person that died
from rabies (four suspect human rabies deaths of patients who did
not receive any PEP), whilst of patients with Category II and III
exposures that were interviewed, 11/19 (58%) were bitten by probable
rabid dogs. Given the high travel times (although underestimated by
the friction surface) and incidence of reported rabies exposures and
deaths, we predict a large but unobserved rabies burden in this
remote community (~6.02 deaths per year) and we ranked a clinic
provisioning PEP in Anosibe An’ala 28th for travel time reductions.
Other remote communities likely experience similar high and
unrecognized burden, but improved surveillance is necessary to
identify such areas. Notably, bite patients in this district
demonstrate willingness to travel for free PEP (in some cases
walking 3 days to a clinic) with awareness of rabies risk. Community
outreach and active surveillance in other remote areas could also
greatly improve people’s awareness of risk and health seeking
behavior.</p></li>
<li><p>Recently, a middle-aged taxi driver died of rabies in suburban
Antananarivo. The day after being bitten by an unknown dog, he
reported to a clinic that referred him to the closest clinic
provisioning PEP, approximately one hour’s drive from his home. His
family urged him to go, but he did not believe his risk was high and
decided not to seek further care. He developed symptoms two weeks
later and was confirmed as a rabies death by the National Rabies
Reference Laboratory. Despite prompt reporting, appropriate
referral, and socioeconomic indicators suggesting a high
care-seeking probability, this person did not receive PEP. His story
highlights the need for sensitization about rabies, how PEP
provisioning at peripheral clinics (even in areas with reasonable
access) could prevent additional deaths, and ultimately that PEP
alone is unlikely to prevent all rabies deaths.</p></li>

<div id="broader-context" class="section level3" number="3.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Broader context</h3>
<p>Recent studies have estimated access to health-seeking behavior and PEP
completion and adherence, but not directly linked these estimates to
burden [7,36,37]. Our approach for incorporating access to vaccines
(echoing [38–42]) into burden estimation methods could guide
provisioning of PEP to maximize impacts. This approach will have most
value in settings with limited PEP access and poor health seeking, but
will be less valuable where rabies exposures make up a small fraction of
patients reporting for PEP e.g. [43,44]. In other settings, similar
statistical approaches could be used to identify and quantify key
barriers to PEP seeking behavior. For example, reducing the direct cost
of PEP is likely to be of more importance than increasing geographic
access where PEP costs are high.</p>
<p>Our revised estimate of rabies deaths in Madagascar using this approach
was higher than previously estimated (between 280 - 750 deaths/year)
[15], which assumed uniform reporting of 85%, but remained within the
range of other empirical and modeling studies from low-income countries
[26,27,45–47]. Our estimates of vial demand depend on use of the new
abridged intradermal regimen [28], which has been adopted by the
Ministry of Health in Madagascar. However, most clinic staff were not
aware of WHO classifications of exposure categories, and vaccination of
Category I exposures (those not requiring PEP) remains common practice,
comprising 20% of vial demand in Moramanga [15].</p>
<p>We predict that as clinics are expanded, throughput (daily patients
reporting to a clinic) will decrease. This may complicate the supply
chain and make provisioning PEP more challenging as vial demand becomes
less predictable, leading to stock outs or wastage. Decentralized
provisioning mechanisms, for example adopting routine childhood vaccine
supply chains, or novel vaccine delivery methods such as drones [48],
may mitigate these challenges. When nerve tissue vaccines were used in
Madagascar, clinics requested vaccines upon demand and PEP access was
more widespread, but provisioning the more expensive cell culture
vaccines to all clinics became too costly [16]. Widespread vaccine
provisioning is therefore feasible given Madagascar’s health
infrastructure, if cost barriers are removed.</p>
<p>Gavi investment could greatly reduce the access and cost barriers to PEP
[6,7,22,49]. Currently, each clinic in Madagascar serves an average
catchment of 780,000 persons. Latin American countries, where
significant progress has been made towards elimination, aim for one PEP
clinic per 100,000 persons. In Madagascar this would require around 212
additional clinics provisioning PEP. We predict that Gavi investment
would be highly cost-effective, greatly reducing deaths by expanding PEP
supply to underserved areas.</p>
<p>However, our results suggest that PEP expansion alone cannot prevent the
majority of rabies deaths, and even given maximal access, achieving ‘the
last mile,’ preventing deaths in the most remote populations, will
require disproportionate resources [50]. To achieve ‘Zero by 30,’ mass
dog vaccination will be key to interrupting transmission and eliminating
deaths. Integrated Bite Case Management (IBCM) uses bite patient risk
assessments to determine rabies exposure status, guide PEP
administration, and trigger investigations of rabid animals, potentially
identifying other exposed persons [15,51,52]. IBCM is one way to
manage PEP effectively [43] and as it relies on exposed persons
reporting to clinics, expanding PEP access could strengthen this
surveillance framework. These same issues of access, however, apply to
both dog vaccination and surveillance, and understanding spatial
heterogeneities will be critical to determining how control and
prevention interventions can be best implemented [53,54].</p>

<div id="conclusion" class="section level2" number="3.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our study suggests that rabies deaths in Madagascar disproportionately
occur in communities with the poorest access to PEP and that expanding
PEP access should reduce deaths. Without data on rabies incidence and
exposure risk, targeting PEP expansion to underserved areas is a
strategic way to reduce rabies burden and provide equitable access, for
example, by expanding provisioning to clinics serving populations that
target an evidence-based travel time threshold or catchment size.
Implementing outreach programs to raise awareness should further
increase the efficacy of PEP expansion by improving care seeking. Better
surveillance is also needed to understand the geographical distribution
of rabies exposures and identify populations most at risk, and to
evaluate the effectiveness of PEP expansion at preventing human rabies
deaths. Gavi investment could support countries to more equitably
provision PEP and overcome barriers to access ([9], see Box 1 for case
studies), but as PEP alone cannot prevent all rabies deaths, investment
should be used to catalyze mass dog vaccination to interrupt
transmission, and eventually eliminate rabies deaths.</p>
